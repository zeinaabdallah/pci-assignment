Self-Configuration is an essential feature in the Self-Organizing Networks, as it recognizes newly deployed base stations and automatically adjusts their configuration parameters 
considering observations from neighboring cells as well. A critical parameter to be configured is the Physical Cell Identity (PCI), which can greatly affect the network performance
and usersâ€™ QoS. In this work, the main focus is on the PCI assignment for Small Cellular Base Stations (SCBSs) in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HetNets), seeing that
HetNets are proposed for their capacity to handle the explosive growth of network data
traffic. However, with the limited number of available PCIs, and the aim to reduce PCI
conflicts and confusions, it can be challenging to allocate and reuse PCIs to cells in hot
areas without affecting the performance of the cellular network. Clustering techniques are used to divide a mobility dataset of users into different
clusters of high activity. Their identification contributes to the PCI allocation process, which gets modelled as a graph coloring problem.
